# Hi there, I'm Joey ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate data analytics instructor with a diverse background in data analysis, teaching, and software engineering. I currently work at [CoopCareers](https://coopcareers.org), where I help shape the future of aspiring data analysts.

## About Me

At CoopCareers, I teach the fundamentals of data analytics using tools like Microsoft Excel, SQL, Tableau, and Python. My role involves not only instructing students but also providing guidance to fellow instructors and Coop shoppers. Through my efforts, I've helped over 80+ individuals secure full-time roles in the tech industry across various domains, including digital marketing companies and financial institutions.

In addition to data analytics, I have a background in software engineering with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Redux, React Native, and the ability to build full stack web applications. You can find my software engineering repositories and the products I've worked on at [github.com/glongia18](https://github.com/glongia18). I enjoy coming up with technical solutions for various types of projects, not just focusing on the project itself but also on innovative problem-solving.

## My Passion

I am deeply committed to fostering a sense of community, continuously learning new things, and staying curious. I believe in revolutionizing educational systems through innovative pedagogy, ensuring that learning is accessible and impactful for everyone.

I am also a founding member of the FreeStack initiative, where we aim to democratize educational systems for the greater good. Our goal is to provide a more equitable learning experience for people across the world through the use of the internet and by making technological applications more readily available.
